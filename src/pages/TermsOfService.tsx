              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Need-Donation is a platform that connects patients in need of financial assistance for medical treatment with individuals willing to donate. We provide a space for patients to share their stories and verification details, and for donors to connect directly with them. We do not handle or process any donations directlyâ€”all transactions occur between donors and patients without our involvement.
              </p>
